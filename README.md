## About application

### Main code
Main application code was written using `TypeScript` and `React`. `Bootstrap` was used for styles and enriched using `SCSS` pre-procesor. `Axios` is used to handle asynchronous requests to the API. Routing is handled by `react-router-dom`.

### Tests
`Jest` is used for running tests, while `Enzyme` was used to write all of them.

### Misc
Polyfill named `es6-promise-promise` had to be used in order to solve IE11's lack of support for `Promise`.
